# Statistics and Information about our discovered Weibo Clusters

We provide LLaMa 3.1 summaries of the contents and PMI information for the top clusters within this directory.

We use pointwise mutual information (PMI) to measure the probability of co-occurrence between each Weibo narrative and each news ecosystem. For each ecosystem and Weibo narrative combination, a PMI value is calculated. The Weibo narrative is most associated with the news ecosystem, which has the largest PMI value.
