# Statistics and Information about our discovered Weibo Clusters

We provide information about some of the top Weibo narrative clusters. We provide information for narrative clusters that had similar articles or narratives amongst our set of Chinese, US, Russian, and Ukrainian websites, providing their  LLaMa 3.1 summaries of the contents and PMI information.

We use pointwise mutual information (PMI) to measure the probability of co-occurrence between each Weibo narrative and each news ecosystem. For each ecosystem and Weibo narrative combination, a PMI value is calculated. The Weibo narrative is most associated with the news ecosystem, which has the largest PMI value. We provide their normalized values in this directory for interpretability.
